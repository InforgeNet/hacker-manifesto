Hacker Manifesto 2.0
Inspired to "The Consciene of a Hacker" by The Mentor
January 8, 1986

This is our world now..
A world made of electron and switch, the beauty of the bandwidth.

We use a service already existing without paying
And that would be incredibly cheap if it wasn’t managed by greedy bastards
too focused on which tie would fit them best for work
instead of stopping for just 5 fucking seconds to think if
this is the kind of world they want to leave for who will come after us.
And they call us criminals.

You see, we are explorers, we search for knowledge in a sea of shit 
that everyday you shove down our throat with your propaganda, with your
advertisement,
with those cheap puppets that you use to make us think and
act as you have already decided for us.

“According to a study, young people today spend most of their time on a smartphone while ignoring the world around them. They have no ideals nor a clear identity. Are they all the same?”

You can bet your ass we are all the same..
In school, they fed us with baby food while we were craving for steak.
The pieces of meat that you left for us were already chewed and 
tasteless.

We have been dominated by sadists and ignored by apathetic people, and the few of them
that really had something to teach found eager students in us,
but they are like drops of water in a desert.
We exist without skin colour, without nationality, 
without religious and sexual prejudice... and you call us criminals.

You build nuclear weapons, you cause wars, you kill, you deceive,
you lie and you try to make us believe it is for our own good.
..and yet we are the criminals.
Yes, I am a criminal. My crime is curiosity. My crime is
to judge people for what they say and what they think, not for their
appearance.

My crime was to outsmart you, that is something you will never forgive me for.
I am an hacker, and this is my manifesto. You can stop me,
but you can’t stop all of us.. Afterall, we are all the same.
